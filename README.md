Created a simple calculator in React. Can perform all the basic functions.

## Optimizations

This app does functionially what I wanted it to do. I would like to circle back and play with Modals and states so that when the user attemps to delete or edit a todo, they ar eprompted with an "are you sure" messsage.

## Lessons Learned:

Increasing familiarity with the possibilities and limitations of components. Was also able to mess around with states a tad. I'm becoming more familiar with jsx and how to handle events. After creating a todo list prior using strictly javascript I'm able to see how useful React can be.
